# Getting Started with NDP

This guide has been designed to introduce you to the main services of the National Data Platform (NDP) and allow you to run your first jobs on high computing instances. By the end of this tutorial, you will accomplish the following:

- Explore the data catalog
- Launch a computing instance
- Execute a simple analysis

**What is NDP?**

The National Data Platform, or NDP, is a federated and extensible data ecosystem to promote collaboration, innovation, and equitable use of data on top of existing cyberinfrastructure capabilities.

**What services are included?**

- CKAN Catalog: A federated data catalog with an extensive collection of big datasets, streaming data, and Open Knowledge Networks.
- JupyterHub: Users can easily collaborate and develop their work through the JupyterHub Environment.
- ML Flow: Users can monitor the status of their training jobs, as well as their performance through the incorporation of ML Flow.

**Who can use NDP?**

NDP is committed to open and equitable data access. All individuals with an interest in developing AI to contribute to science and to develop solutions to current societal problems, are invited to use NDP.

**What do I need to know to use NDP?**

NDP collection of datasets varies on a range of topics and domains. The development of . Nonetheless, familiarity with JupyterHub and Python programming is fundamental to start working with NDP. Users can consult Open Learning Resources.

## Getting Started

**Catalog**

One of the main features of NDP is the extensive data catalog. This catalog contains datasets, open knowledge networks, as well as access to streaming data instances. For each data, NDP provides the
The catalog is powered by the [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) open-source data management system, allowing users to open

**Launching Computing Resources**

NDP allows users to explore and work on data by facilitating access to the National Science Foundation's cyberinfrastructure (CI) capabilities. For the case of this analysis, we are going to connect with [Nautilus](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/nautilus/), a hypercluster which facilitates the work with Big Data.

To connect with Nautilus and launch a computational instance, we will start by clicking at the Jupyter Hub button next to our dataset.
